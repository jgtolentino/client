“Champion Detergent is up 23.6%—excellent. Can you cross-sell with Hana Shampoo for even bigger baskets?”

“Cebu and Bacolod both posted strong numbers. Replicate what’s working in those cities across similar regions.”

5. Snackable Insight Banners (for AI/Action Panel)
Instead of just listing stats, turn top changes into mini-stories or alerts.

“🔥 Del Monte Spaghetti Sauce jumped by ₱600K this week. Check if the new promo is working—or if it’s just a one-off spike.”

“⚠️ Oishi Marty's is down 8%. Investigate—are you losing share to a competitor, or did a key account pause orders?”

“💡 Krem-Top is gaining ground—up 10%. Try pairing with afternoon snack bundles.”

7. Summary of Principles
Be Specific: Use real numbers and % changes for every key insight.

Give Clear Calls to Action: “Double down,” “Monitor for drops,” “Bundle with X.”

Add Context: “Spiked after campaign launch,” “Dipped post-holiday,” “Uptrend for 3 weeks.”

Be Human: Use casual, clear language as if you’re briefing a marketing team.
