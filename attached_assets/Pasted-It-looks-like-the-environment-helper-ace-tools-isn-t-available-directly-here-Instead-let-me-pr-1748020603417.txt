It looks like the environment helper (`ace_tools`) isn’t available directly here. Instead, let me present the same data in a concise markdown table for clarity—and then generate a couple of sample insights that highlight TBWA clients versus competitors.

### Example Generated Insights

1. **TBWA Client Performance**
   “Del Monte Sauce leads the category with ₱2.4M in sales, outperforming non-client competitors by 20% this period.”

2. **Competitive Gaps**
   “Alaska Evaporated Milk (TBWA) saw a 12% increase in sales, while Nescafé Coffee (competitor) only grew by 5%, indicating stronger brand resonance for your client in the dairy segment.”

3. **Opportunity Spotting**
   “Magnolia Ice Cream (competitor) still maintains ₱1.6M in frozen sales—consider a targeted promotions push for Alaska Ice to capture that segment.”

**Next Steps**

* Wire in your `/api/brands` endpoint to pull real flags for `TBWA_Client` and drive this table dynamically in the Brand Performance grid.
* Update the front-end “Brand Performance” component to style TBWA clients with your brand colors and mark competitors in a secondary style.
* Flip between simulated (`/data/sim/brands.json`) and live (`/api/brands?client=true`) sources via your Data-Source toggle.

Let me know if you want the exact patch for the React/Vue/JSX component to render these flags visually!
